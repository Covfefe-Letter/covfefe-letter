# Covfefe Letter

An app that helps you write cover letters better than our President can write tweets. 

HTML | CSS | jQuery | Loopback | IBM Watson APIs

Made by @jodiely (Developer at Large), @keziyah (Engineer Extraordinaire), @MariannaAtPlay (Queen of Codeland), @rachelfreya (Hacker in Chief), and @ys238 (Empress of Ideas). 

A project started at the 2017 Mobile Monday API First Hackathon (June 3-5). 

## Installation

Clone it, go into the directory, and npm start. 

## How It Works

Write, or copy and paste a cover letter for a specific job description. 
When you're finished, click analyze, and we'll tell you how you did. 
For example, we'll give you feedback on how confident your letter sounds, or whether some of your sentences sound too angry.

Need ideas? Click on the suggestions tab and paste in the url for the job
description. We'll give you keywords from the description that you can 
incorporate into your letter.
